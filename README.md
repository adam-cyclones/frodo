# Frodo - ForgeROck DO

This is the ForgeROck DO - or short frodo - command line interface, a CLI to manage ForgeRock platform deployments. Frodo supports Identity Cloud tenants, ForgeOps deployments, and classic deployments.

Frodo is the successor to field tools like [amtree.sh](https://github.com/vscheuber/AM-treetool), [fidc-debug-tools](https://github.com/vscheuber/fidc-debug-tools), and ForgeRock-internal utilities.

Please refer to the [GitHub README](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo#readme) for full documentation.
